  To-Do:
    ✔ Do the UI/Prototype @done(23-03-24 14:17)
      ✔ I have the form input styled @done(22-12-20 14:59)

      Global View / Post View:
        ☐ Improve Appearance
          ☐ Get the colours in place

        ✔ Animate post when it's new @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ Give it a new tag that is removed after 30 seconds? @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ The main issue i had is that the key was using index which doesn't change on render so i just switched to the post id and it worked...i wasted so much time on this i am actually annoyed. At least the problem is solved and new posts animate on render and won't animate after a set amount of time @done(23-02-13 17:51)
          ...i think i need to change the way I save my timestamp in order to achieve this.
          ✔ Added animation to new post @done(23-02-14 15:59)
        ✔ Remove the @ @done(23-02-16 11:20)
        ✔ Add Time Stamp @done(23-01-13 16:53)

        ✔ Add indicator that post is new, that changes after 60 seconds @done(23-02-14 13:57)
          ✔ I have the core in place, just need to style it @done(23-02-14 15:59)
        ✔ There is a post duplication bug that duplicates the post array over and over. It's not endless it's just duplicating what's currently in the array...which is then duplicated. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
          ✔ Trying to figure out what's going on here. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ It's the delete button, it's doubling the array on delete... @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ Fixed it, i was accidentally copying the array without the delete post onto the another array without the deleted post instead of just saving the array without the delete post to begin with. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
        ✔ Create New Edit Button @done(23-04-25 11:18)

        ✔ Switch appearance to new design language as seen in author input @done(23-04-25 11:18)

          ✔ 1 - Get the information needed for the view @done(23-04-13 18:22)
          ✔ 2 - A Component for the View @done(23-04-13 18:22)
        
        ✔ Add Pagination @done(23-04-25 11:17)
          ✔ When a certain amount of posts are added add a button that lets you change the posts rendered on the page. @done(23-04-25 11:17)
        
        Share bar:
          ☐ Create the Share Bar
            ✔ UI created @done(23-04-25 11:44)
            ☐ Do i want the buttons to work?

      Adding Posts / Author Input:

        Tags:
          ✔ Make the tags menu look better @done(23-02-22 17:07)
          ✔ Add file upload to replace/add to the current add images button @done(23-03-24 14:17)
            ✔ Done, just need to clean up the code a bit @done(23-03-24 14:17)
            ✔ style input @done(23-02-22 17:17)
              ✔ The current styling is to bland, need to do something about this.At least the functionality is in, i just need to rethink my approach here. @done(23-02-22 17:43)
          ✔ Title should have tags support @done(23-04-13 16:14)
          ✔ Subtitle should have tags support @done(23-04-13 16:14)
          ☐ There should be single tags menu with all available tags, instead of the hard coded Japan option

        ✔ Ability to cancel image upload @done(23-02-17 18:12)
        ✔ Indicate that image has been uploaded @done(23-02-17 18:12)
        ✔ The image has to stay at the top due to limitations with tiptap. I could probably figure out a way of integrating the image into the body but that's just too much work for this project. @done(23-02-17 17:23)
    
        ✔ Ability to cancel adding post @done(22-12-20 17:03)
        ✔ Ability to edit post @done(23-03-24 14:17)

        ✔ Ability to delete post / hide post @done(23-01-20 16:37)
        ✔ It should be more obvious that a post is hidden @done(23-02-09 19:10)
        ✔ Ability to add video @done(23-02-22 16:19)
          ✔ i think this is just a part of tiptap now @done(23-02-21 12:15)
          ✔ added video... @done(23-02-21 12:15)
            ✔ ...but the youtube placeholder displays even if you don't add a video. @done(23-02-22 16:19)
          ...it only appears in the item review window, so not actually an issue but still annoying
        ✔ Add Twitter card @done(23-02-21 11:53)
        ✔ Create New Create New Post Button @done(23-04-12 17:28)
        ✔ Create New Toggle CPanel Button @done(23-04-12 17:28)

        ✔ Switch Inputs over to new design style shown in the Control Panel @done(23-04-12 12:12)

        ✔ Add Option for simple form and complex form @done(23-04-12 18:30)
          ✔ Simple - Title + Body @done(23-04-12 18:29)
          ✔ Complex - Every Option @done(23-04-12 18:29)
        
        ✔ The Types aren't working, showing undefined in html @done(23-04-13 16:26)
        ✔ The image is also not appearing @done(23-04-13 16:17)

        ☐ Keyboard SUpport
          ☐ Pressing Enter should submit the post when ready
        
      Editing Posts:
        ✔ Fields to edit @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Title @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Subtitle @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Body @done(23-02-08 13:39)
        ✔ Close edit mode on save @done(23-02-08 13:59)
        ✔ Remove border around fields @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ It should be obvious the post is being edited. @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ Im thinking about changing the post/edit structure. I would like the new post and edit stuff to be in the same block but I'm not sure I want to comit to that sort of refactor at this point at it would require a rewrite of the core of the website. @done(23-03-24 14:17)
          I think an extensive floating menu might be the best option at the moment.
          ...then i think that having a big input form doing nothing is a waste.
          ...not sure how to proceed, hence the lack of progress over the last day.
          ...I have tried a few things but there are downsides to whatever i do here.
          ✔ Did it. I had to get a refresher in redux but I have changed the post being edited to appear in the author input form instead of the post itself. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
            ✔ This allows all benefits of using the full form instead of trying to cram in all of the options into the post. @done(23-02-23 18:50)
            ✔ I'm pretty proud i managed this to be honest. @done(23-02-23 18:50)
            Next Steps:
              ✔ Can the new post and edit post forms use the same codebase? @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                ...it would certainly make the code a lot slimmer and easier to maintain.
                ....give me about 2 years to figure this out.
                ....i've just realised i still need to hoom the edit field up to the item-review section so that might actually bring the 2 codebases together anyway. Let's see what happens.
              ✔ Yes, i can use the new edit post component as a new post component. @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                ✔ It's a lot of work and theres' going to be issues but I have made good progress so far and will be worth it when the transition is complete. The existing components are also a bit crap so it will be better to maintain and use. @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                ✔ I have mostly achieved this. I still have the edit post and new post as separate components but the code duplication has been signficantly reduced. I am happy with where I am now @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                
                Todo:
                  ✔ Recreate fields: @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                    ✔ TItle @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                    ✔ Subtitle @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                    ✔ Type @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                    ✔ Tweet @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                    ✔ Youtube @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                    ✔ Body @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                    ✔ Tags @done(23-03-07 17:16)
                  ☐ Issues
                    ✔ The clear content functionality doesn't work now, figure out an alternative @done(23-03-24 14:16)
                      ...otherwise you can keep adding the same post by clicking the create new post button
                      I've created the functionality for editing post but need to add it for new posts
                        Ok so i couldnt figure out how to clear the fields after adding a new post so i have created an overlay that will force the author to manually reset the field. This can double as final confirmation because i give up. i dont know to do thos any other way.
                        This might actually be a a good thing as I can turn the overlay in a control panel of sorts. I was going to create a separate panel for logging out, view public view etc but with this new overlay i can just it for those purposes.
                    ✔ Create a check to ensure a minimum amount of content has been added before a form can be submitted @done(23-03-07 17:55)
                      ...title, subtitle, body etc...

              ✔ Ensure all of the buttons are working as intended. @done(23-03-07 17:16)
              ✔ Style the form @done(23-03-03 17:46)
              ✔ Saving a post doesn't close the edit mode in the post. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✔ Add formatting options to edit fields @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✔ Add tags in edit field. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✔ Ability to change optional id:- @done(23-03-03 17:46)
          ✔ Twitter Id @done(23-03-03 17:46)
          ✔ Youtube Id @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✘ The page junps when toggling edit mode. @cancelled(23-04-25 11:46)
          ...i think this is the author input rendering  every time state refreshes.
        ✘ Fix styling bug? @cancelled(23-03-03 17:47)
        ✘ Add a quicker way of removing content from fields when editing. @cancelled(23-04-14 12:06)
        ✔ Integrate Item Review @done(23-03-03 17:47)
          ...i am trying to get the item review to switch over to the current post on edit but struggling to get it to work.
          ...so instead of fitting the edited item review into the new item review, im going to create a second item review just for the edited item.
          ...hopefully this will lead me to figure out how to do it from the one component if possible.
          ✘ I can use a useEffect but that would also update the live version. @cancelled(23-03-02 17:41)
                ...maybe if a post is being edited it should be hidden
                ...nah, that just seems a bit arbitrary and there are reasons a post can remain up even if it needs to be changed
          ✔ DId it, i created a previewSlice in redux and used that to separate the existing post from the preview post. This also an in progress post from a preview post so you only see the pest you're editing in the preview box. @done(23-03-02 17:42)
          ✔ I now have a functional item review area that previews new posts and posts being edited using mostly the same code, apart from the redux sections. @done(23-03-02 17:42)
          ✔ Now i just need to fill out the rest of the possible form entries, clean up the code and then style the edit form. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
              ✔ Fill out remaining form entries @done(23-03-03 17:46)
              ✔ Saving an edit on a post with an image, removes the image. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✔ Create New Save Button @done(23-04-13 16:58)
        ✔ Create New Delete Button @done(23-04-13 16:58)
            ✔ Add Confirmation Box @done(23-04-14 12:36)
        ✔ Create New Hide Button @done(23-04-13 17:21)
        ✔ The Control Bar is a mess with the new style, fix this @done(23-04-13 17:21)
        ✔ The types need to be fixed @done(23-04-13 17:15)
        ✔ The padding for the names is off @done(23-04-13 17:21)
        ✔ Saving an edit should return you to the control panel @done(23-04-13 17:21)
        ✔ Deleting a post should return you to the control panel @done(23-04-13 17:35)
        ✔ Integrate the simple/complex form views. @done(23-04-13 17:48)
        ✔ Change the indicator that the post is being edited. @done(23-04-13 18:01)
            ✔ It should be much more obvious which post is being edited. @done(23-04-13 18:01)

        Issues:
          Creating a new post is returning an error object is not extensible which i understand. I don't understand why the exact same object from local storage is extensible but the same array from state is not.
            ✔ It works with the local storage array but it's annoying me @done(23-04-07 15:19)
          ✔ I'm changing the post behaviour so that it doesn't return to the Control Panel when you create a new post. @done(23-04-07 16:48)
          ✔ I think the previous work on changing the post structure has broken the delete button @done(23-04-07 16:58)
            ✔ I forgot to update the delete code to include the headline. @done(23-04-07 16:56)
      
      Post Control Bar:
        ✔ Create single codebase that can act as control for edit, hide and delete @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ Style control bar @done(23-02-09 18:52)
          ... also made the jump between to edit less jarring by moving the timestamp and social media bar out of the edit mode check.
        ✔ Should be hidden if not logged in. @done(23-02-09 19:14)
      
      Summary Bar:
        ☐ Place above live text in logged in
        ☐ Place to the left in logged out



      Create Login / Logout system:
        ✔ Added Google Authentication Sign In @done(23-04-27 17:35)
        ✔ Next, i should create a firestore so that users can have store information on the website. @done(23-04-27 17:35)
          It's the same processs as the netflix app but with GOogle Signin rather than email, password
          ✔ Step 1 - Sign In With Google @done(23-04-25 16:15)
          ✔ Step 2 - Use Google Unique Id to create a user in the database @done(23-04-27 17:34)
          So i've managed to create a database collection with the same id as the auth id.
            The main issue is that signing in will overwrite whatever is saved in the database
            I've made a bit of a meal of this so will probably need to restart but i dont think it should be too hard
            ✔ Lol, just realised im using code for V8 of firebase, when I actually have v9 installed @done(23-04-26 17:45)
              ....that was a waste of like 3 hours...
            ✔ Ok after that i did manage to get a system in place @done(23-04-26 17:47)
              ✔ You can login with google authenticate @done(23-04-26 17:47)
              ✔ A new record is created and you're logged in @done(23-04-26 17:47)
              ✔ If you're signing in, then your columns are loaded into the page @done(23-04-26 17:47)

        The basics are in place but there are issues
          Issues / ToDo:
            ✔ After logging in, columns are loaded into the livetext array but the page isn't updated @done(23-04-27 17:17)
              ✔ Done, added a useEffect to the Control Panel to set the state of live texts as soon as the main website array gets it's information @done(23-04-27 17:17)
            ☐ Logging in, there's no active column
              ☐ I'd like this to be something that can be remembered in storage
            ✔ The save columns button should be a background function of the website @done(23-04-27 17:41)
            ✔ There should be a login slice that keeps track of whether the user is logged in @done(23-04-27 18:25)
            ☐ The Logout UI should just be the UI without the author-input component.
            ☐ The new user UI needs to be improved
            ☐ The UI in general    needs tidied
            ✔ BUG:: Logging Out -> Refresh Page -> Sign In = Delete Columns @done(23-04-28 18:35)
              I think this might be a sign of a much larger issue with the way my project is setup
              I think the local storage is the priority information source rather than the database which is causing issues when the local storage is cleared. This triggers the setDoc which clears the information in the firestore.
              ✔ I removed the useEffect which updates everytime the main array changes and replaced it with a manual SaveColumns function that is called everytime postControl and manageColumns updates the main array. Not sure if this is optimal but it's what I came up with. @done(23-04-28 18:35)
              ✔ Could this work with the live text slice? @done(23-04-28 18:40)
                ✔ Yup @done(23-04-28 18:40)
        Logged Out Ui:
          ☐ Create a single centred panel that lets users login


      Control Panel:
        ☐ A single panel to do a variety of things.
          ✔ Create New Post @done(23-03-14 15:47)
          ☐ View Public View(hide the control panel and display the summary panel)
          ☐ Logout(like above but with user account interaction)
          Manage live texts:
            ✔ Im thinking that a single account can have multiple live texts in their account that they can view and manage. @done(23-03-24 14:15)
            This panel will allow simple interactions between these accounts
              ✔ Create new live texts @done(23-03-24 14:15)
                ✔ Create a button that lets you add live texts to an array. @done(23-03-24 14:15)
                  Christ that took ages. The solution is actually a lot simpler than I was trying which means I'm overthinking things too much. I'm still not actually done as I have new posts being added to an array inside an object that contains the current live text content. I now need to save this content to the master live text and render that in the global view.
                Now I need to add new posts to a specfic live text array
                That took even longer.
                  About a week actually.
                  I had to redo most of the post control, author input and global view functions to make this work.
                    There's a lot that has been changed and it wasn't easy to get here, but I have succeeded in making panel that lets you switch between columns(live-texts) from a single control panel
                    There a lot that needs to be done but the biggest part of this has been achieved. This was a struggle, no lie, but It makes the website better.

              ✔ Hide button @done(23-03-24 14:14)
                ✔ Done, but again the code needs to be slimmed down like the edit button. @done(23-03-24 12:09)
              ✔ Delete button @done(23-03-24 14:14)
                ✔ Done, but again the code needs to be slimmed down like the edit button. @done(23-03-24 12:09)
            ✔ Fix Edit function @done(23-03-24 14:14)
              ✔ Had to change how to toggle the CPanel first, which I have and can now deal with refactoring the rest of the post control component. @done(23-03-24 14:14)
              ✔ Clicking Edit button now renders current post into edit view @done(23-03-22 11:55)
              ✔ Recreated edit function @done(23-03-22 18:21)
              ✔ Pressing hide shouldnt close the edit view @done(23-03-24 14:14)
              ✔ I'm rebuidling the edit activation as it's become a bit of a mess at this point. I think that I can do better now. @done(23-03-24 14:14)
                The problem is that the hide choice is not being respected on save so it's causing issues.
                I actually think the problem is in the save button. Reloading the page keeps the edit mode and hide as is but saving using the button in post control is resetting things for some reason.
                ✔ ....i forgot to add hidden to newPostItems object. @done(23-03-24 14:14)
                /// kill me.
                ✔ You should'nt be able to toggle CPanel if editMode is active @done(23-03-24 14:05)
                ✔ Toggling the Cpanel/Adding New Post and then pressing the edit button sets edit mode true but hide the edit view. This is wrong and breaks the UI @done(23-03-24 14:11)
                  ✔ Maybe only display the edit button when the CPanel is active. @done(23-03-24 14:11)
            ✔ Create Simple / Complex view for control panel @done(23-05-03 10:58)
            ✔ Pressing enter in the column field should trigger the post the same as pressing the button @done(23-05-03 11:32)
