    ✔ Setup Github @done(22-12-01 11:35)
  To-Do:
    ☐ Do the UI/Prototype
      ✔ I have the form input styled @done(22-12-20 14:59)

      Global View
      ☐ Improve Appearance
        ☐ Get the colours in place
        ✔ Make title bold by default @done(23-02-17 18:16)
        ✔ Style links to not be blue @done(23-02-17 18:19)
        ✔ Add images @done(23-02-17 18:19)
        ✔ Add social @done(23-02-21 11:48)
          ✔ Integrated twitter cards using react-twitter-widgets library @done(23-02-21 11:45)
        ✔ bring title and subtitle closer together @done(23-02-17 18:19)
        ✔ improve new tag @done(23-02-21 11:48)
        ✔ change font @done(23-02-17 18:23)
      ☐ Adding Posts
        ✔ Animate post when it's new @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ Give it a new tag that is removed after 30 seconds? @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ The main issue i had is that the key was using index which doesn't change on render so i just switched to the post id and it worked...i wasted so much time on this i am actually annoyed. At least the problem is solved and new posts animate on render and won't animate after a set amount of time @done(23-02-13 17:51)
          ...i think i need to change the way I save my timestamp in order to achieve this.
          ✔ Added animation to new post @done(23-02-14 15:59)
        ✔ Remove the @ @done(23-02-16 11:20)
        ✔ Add Time Stamp @done(23-01-13 16:53)
          ✔ This should be an easy way to get myself back into the swing of things. @done(23-01-13 16:53)
          ✔ Pretty simple with day.js @done(23-01-13 16:53)
        ✔ Different style depending on update type @done(23-02-16 12:02)
        ☐ Add Share bar
          
        ✔ Add indicator that post is new, that changes after 60 seconds @done(23-02-14 13:57)
          ✔ I have the core in place, just need to style it @done(23-02-14 15:59)
        ✔ There is a post duplication bug that duplicates the post array over and over. It's not endless it's just duplicating what's currently in the array...which is then duplicated. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
          ✔ Trying to figure out what's going on here. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ It's the delete button, it's doubling the array on delete... @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ Fixed it, i was accidentally copying the array without the delete post onto the another array without the deleted post instead of just saving the array without the delete post to begin with. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
        ✔ Make the tags menu look better @done(23-02-22 17:07)
        ☐ Add file upload to replace/add to the current add images button
          ☐ Done, just need to clean up the code a bit
          ✔ style input @done(23-02-22 17:17)
            ✔ The current styling is to bland, need to do something about this.At least the functionality is in, i just need to rethink my approach here. @done(23-02-22 17:43)
          ✔ Ability to cancel image upload @done(23-02-17 18:12)
          ✔ Indicate that image has been uploaded @done(23-02-17 18:12)
          ✔ The image has to stay at the top due to limitations with tiptap. I could probably figure out a way of integrating the image into the body but that's just too much work for this project. @done(23-02-17 17:23)
            
          

      ✔ Ability to cancel adding post @done(22-12-20 17:03)
      ☐ Ability to edit post 
        ✔ Fields to edit @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Title @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Subtitle @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Body @done(23-02-08 13:39)
        ✔ Close edit mode on save @done(23-02-08 13:59)
        ✔ Remove border around fields @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ It should be obvious the post is being edited. @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ☐ Im thinking about changing the post/edit structure. I would like the new post and edit stuff to be in the same block but I'm not sure I want to comit to that sort of refactor at this point at it would require a rewrite of the core of the website.
          I think an extensive floating menu might be the best option at the moment.
          ...then i think that having a big input form doing nothing is a waste.
          ...not sure how to proceed, hence the lack of progress over the last day.
          ...I have tried a few things but there are downsides to whatever i do here.
          ☐ Did it. I had to get a refresher in redux but I have changed the post being edited to appear in the author input form instead of the post itself.
            ✔ This allows all benefits of using the full form instead of trying to cram in all of the options into the post. @done(23-02-23 18:50)
            ✔ I'm pretty proud i managed this to be honest. @done(23-02-23 18:50)
            Next Steps:
              ☐ Ensure all of the buttons are working as intended.
              ☐ Style the form
              ☐ Saving a post doesn't close the edit mode in the post.
        ☐ Add formatting options to edit fields
        ☐ Add tags in edit field.
        ☐ Ability to change optional id:-
          ☐ Twitter Id
          ☐ Youtube Id
        ☐ The page junps when toggling edit mode.
          ...i think this is the author input rendering  every time state refreshes.
        ☐ Fix styling bug

      ☐ Post Control Bar
        ✔ Create single codebase that can act as control for edit, hide and delete @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ Style control bar @done(23-02-09 18:52)
          ... also made the jump between to edit less jarring by moving the timestamp and social media bar out of the edit mode check.
        ✔ Should be hidden if not logged in. @done(23-02-09 19:14)

      ☐ Add Summary Bar
        ☐ Place above live text in logged in
        ☐ Place to the left in logged out

      ✔ Ability to delete post / hide post @done(23-01-20 16:37)
        ✔ It should be more obvious that a post is hidden @done(23-02-09 19:10)
      ✔ Ability to add video @done(23-02-22 16:19)
        ✔ i think this is just a part of tiptap now @done(23-02-21 12:15)
        ✔ added video... @done(23-02-21 12:15)
        ✔ ...but the youtube placeholder displays even if you don't add a video. @done(23-02-22 16:19)
          ...it only appears in the item review window, so not actually an issue but still annoying
      ✔ Add Twitter card @done(23-02-21 11:53)
      ☐ Create Login / Logout system
