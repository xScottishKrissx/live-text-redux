  Setup:
    ✔ Setup Redux @done(22-12-01 11:29)
    ✔ Setup Github @done(22-12-01 11:35)
  To-Do:
    ☐ Do the UI/Prototype
      ✔ I have the form input styled @done(22-12-20 14:59)

      Global View
      ☐ Improve Appearance
        ☐ Get the colours in place
        ✔ Make title bold by default @done(23-02-17 18:16)
        ✔ Style links to not be blue @done(23-02-17 18:19)
        ✔ Add images @done(23-02-17 18:19)
        ✔ Add social @done(23-02-21 11:48)
          ✔ Integrated twitter cards using react-twitter-widgets library @done(23-02-21 11:45)
        ✔ bring title and subtitle closer together @done(23-02-17 18:19)
        ✔ improve new tag @done(23-02-21 11:48)
        ✔ change font @done(23-02-17 18:23)
      ☐ Adding Posts
        ✔ Animate post when it's new @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ Give it a new tag that is removed after 30 seconds? @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ The main issue i had is that the key was using index which doesn't change on render so i just switched to the post id and it worked...i wasted so much time on this i am actually annoyed. At least the problem is solved and new posts animate on render and won't animate after a set amount of time @done(23-02-13 17:51)
          ...i think i need to change the way I save my timestamp in order to achieve this.
          ✔ Added animation to new post @done(23-02-14 15:59)
        ✔ Remove the @ @done(23-02-16 11:20)
        ✔ Add Time Stamp @done(23-01-13 16:53)
          ✔ This should be an easy way to get myself back into the swing of things. @done(23-01-13 16:53)
          ✔ Pretty simple with day.js @done(23-01-13 16:53)
        ✔ Different style depending on update type @done(23-02-16 12:02)
        ☐ Add Share bar
          
        ✔ Add indicator that post is new, that changes after 60 seconds @done(23-02-14 13:57)
          ✔ I have the core in place, just need to style it @done(23-02-14 15:59)
        ✔ There is a post duplication bug that duplicates the post array over and over. It's not endless it's just duplicating what's currently in the array...which is then duplicated. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
          ✔ Trying to figure out what's going on here. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ It's the delete button, it's doubling the array on delete... @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ Fixed it, i was accidentally copying the array without the delete post onto the another array without the deleted post instead of just saving the array without the delete post to begin with. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
        ✔ Make the tags menu look better @done(23-02-22 17:07)
        ☐ Add file upload to replace/add to the current add images button
          ☐ Done, just need to clean up the code a bit
          ✔ style input @done(23-02-22 17:17)
            ✔ The current styling is to bland, need to do something about this.At least the functionality is in, i just need to rethink my approach here. @done(23-02-22 17:43)
          ✔ Ability to cancel image upload @done(23-02-17 18:12)
          ✔ Indicate that image has been uploaded @done(23-02-17 18:12)
          ✔ The image has to stay at the top due to limitations with tiptap. I could probably figure out a way of integrating the image into the body but that's just too much work for this project. @done(23-02-17 17:23)
            
          

      ✔ Ability to cancel adding post @done(22-12-20 17:03)
      ☐ Ability to edit post 
        ✔ Fields to edit @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Title @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Subtitle @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Body @done(23-02-08 13:39)
        ✔ Close edit mode on save @done(23-02-08 13:59)
        ✔ Remove border around fields @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ It should be obvious the post is being edited. @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ☐ Im thinking about changing the post/edit structure. I would like the new post and edit stuff to be in the same block but I'm not sure I want to comit to that sort of refactor at this point at it would require a rewrite of the core of the website.
          I think an extensive floating menu might be the best option at the moment.
          ...then i think that having a big input form doing nothing is a waste.
          ...not sure how to proceed, hence the lack of progress over the last day.
          ...I have tried a few things but there are downsides to whatever i do here.
          ✔ Did it. I had to get a refresher in redux but I have changed the post being edited to appear in the author input form instead of the post itself. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
            ✔ This allows all benefits of using the full form instead of trying to cram in all of the options into the post. @done(23-02-23 18:50)
            ✔ I'm pretty proud i managed this to be honest. @done(23-02-23 18:50)
            Next Steps:
              ☐ Can the new post and edit post forms use the same codebase?
                ...it would certainly make the code a lot slimmer and easier to maintain.
                ....give me about 2 years to figure this out.
                ....i've just realised i still need to hoom the edit field up to the item-review section so that might actually bring the 2 codebases together anyway. Let's see what happens.
              ☐ Yes, i can use the new edit post component as a new post component.
                ☐ It's a lot of work and theres' going to be issues but I have made good progress so far and will be worth it when the transition is complete. The existing components are also a bit crap so it will be better to maintain and use.
                
                Todo:
                  ☐ Recreate fields:
                    ☐ TItle
                    ☐ Subtitle
                    ☐ Type
                    ☐ Tweet
                    ☐ Youtube
                    ☐ Body
                    ☐ Tags
                  ☐ Issues
                    ☐ THe clear content functionality doesn't work now, figure out an alternative
                      ...otherwise you can keep adding the same post by clicking the create new post button
                    ☐ Create a check to ensure a minimum amount of content has been added before a form can be submitted
                      ...title, subtitle, body etc...

              ☐ Ensure all of the buttons are working as intended.
              ✔ Style the form @done(23-03-03 17:46)
              ✔ Saving a post doesn't close the edit mode in the post. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✔ Add formatting options to edit fields @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✔ Add tags in edit field. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ✔ Ability to change optional id:- @done(23-03-03 17:46)
          ✔ Twitter Id @done(23-03-03 17:46)
          ✔ Youtube Id @done(23-03-03 17:46)
        ☐ The page junps when toggling edit mode.
          ...i think this is the author input rendering  every time state refreshes.
        ✘ Fix styling bug? @cancelled(23-03-03 17:47)
        ☐ Add a quicker way of removing content from fields when editing.
        ✔ Item Review @done(23-03-03 17:47)
          ...i am trying to get the item review to switch over to the current post on edit but struggling to get it to work.
          ...so instead of fitting the edited item review into the new item review, im going to create a second item review just for the edited item.
          ...hopefully this will lead me to figure out how to do it from the one component if possible.
          ✘ I can use a useEffect but that would also update the live version. @cancelled(23-03-02 17:41)
                ...maybe if a post is being edited it should be hidden
                ...nah, that just seems a bit arbitrary and there are reasons a post can remain up even if it needs to be changed
          ✔ DId it, i created a previewSlice in redux and used that to separate the existing post from the preview post. This also an in progress post from a preview post so you only see the pest you're editing in the preview box. @done(23-03-02 17:42)
          ✔ I now have a functional item review area that previews new posts and posts being edited using mostly the same code, apart from the redux sections. @done(23-03-02 17:42)
          ✔ Now i just need to fill out the rest of the possible form entries, clean up the code and then style the edit form. @done(23-03-03 17:46)
              ✔ Fill out remaining form entries @done(23-03-03 17:46)
              ✔ Saving an edit on a post with an image, removes the image. @done(23-03-03 17:46)

      ☐ Post Control Bar
        ✔ Create single codebase that can act as control for edit, hide and delete @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ Style control bar @done(23-02-09 18:52)
          ... also made the jump between to edit less jarring by moving the timestamp and social media bar out of the edit mode check.
        ✔ Should be hidden if not logged in. @done(23-02-09 19:14)
        

      ☐ Add Summary Bar
        ☐ Place above live text in logged in
        ☐ Place to the left in logged out

      ✔ Ability to delete post / hide post @done(23-01-20 16:37)
        ✔ It should be more obvious that a post is hidden @done(23-02-09 19:10)
      ✔ Ability to add video @done(23-02-22 16:19)
        ✔ i think this is just a part of tiptap now @done(23-02-21 12:15)
        ✔ added video... @done(23-02-21 12:15)
        ✔ ...but the youtube placeholder displays even if you don't add a video. @done(23-02-22 16:19)
          ...it only appears in the item review window, so not actually an issue but still annoying
      ✔ Add Twitter card @done(23-02-21 11:53)
      ☐ Create Login / Logout system
