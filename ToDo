  Setup:
    ✔ Setup Redux @done(22-12-01 11:29)
    ✔ Setup Github @done(22-12-01 11:35)
  To-Do:
    ☐ Do the UI/Prototype
      ✔ I have the form input styled @done(22-12-20 14:59)

      
      ☐ Adding Posts
        ✔ Animate post when it's new @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ Give it a new tag that is removed after 30 seconds? @done(23-02-13 17:50)
          ✔ The main issue i had is that the key was using index which doesn't change on render so i just switched to the post id and it worked...i wasted so much time on this i am actually annoyed. At least the problem is solved and new posts animate on render and won't animate after a set amount of time @done(23-02-13 17:51)
          ...i think i need to change the way I save my timestamp in order to achieve this.

        ☐ Remove the @
        ✔ Add Time Stamp @done(23-01-13 16:53)
          ✔ This should be an easy way to get myself back into the swing of things. @done(23-01-13 16:53)
          ✔ Pretty simple with day.js @done(23-01-13 16:53)
        ☐ Different style depending on update type
        ☐ Add Share bar
        ✔ Add indicator that post is new, that changes after 60 seconds @done(23-02-14 13:57)
          ☐ I have the core in place, just need to style it
        ✔ There is a post duplication bug that duplicates the post array over and over. It's not endless it's just duplicating what's currently in the array...which is then duplicated. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
          ✔ Trying to figure out what's going on here. @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ It's the delete button, it's doubling the array on delete... @done(23-02-13 17:22)
            ✔ Fixed it, i was accidentally copying the array without the delete post onto the another array without the deleted post instead of just saving the array without the delete post to begin with. @done(23-02-13 17:22)

      ✔ Ability to cancel adding post @done(22-12-20 17:03)
      ☐ Ability to edit post 
        ✔ Fields to edit @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Title @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Subtitle @done(23-02-08 13:39)
          ✔ Body @done(23-02-08 13:39)
        ✔ Close edit mode on save @done(23-02-08 13:59)
        ✔ Remove border around fields @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ It should be obvious the post is being edited. @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ☐ Add formatting options to edit fields
        ☐ Add tags in edit field.
        ☐ The page junps when toggling edit mode.
          ...i think this is the author input rendering  every time state refreshes.

      ☐ Post Control Bar
        ✔ Create single codebase that can act as control for edit, hide and delete @done(23-02-09 18:26)
        ✔ Style control bar @done(23-02-09 18:52)
          ... also made the jump between to edit less jarring by moving the timestamp and social media bar out of the edit mode check.
        ✔ Should be hidden if not logged in. @done(23-02-09 19:14)


      ✔ Ability to delete post / hide post @done(23-01-20 16:37)
        ✔ It should be more obvious that a post is hidden @done(23-02-09 19:10)
      ☐ Ability to add video
        ☐ i think this is just a part of tiptap now
      ☐ Add Twitter card
      ☐ Create Login / Logout system
